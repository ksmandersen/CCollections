# CCollections

CCollections is a general purpose collection library for the ANSI C programming language. It was insipired by the well known collection libraries for .NET runtime and Java runtime.
CCollections gives programmeres with an object-oriented background a convinient way to use collections in C.
The library provides a familiar and consistent interface to work with collections.

## Memory management

CCollections incorporates support for automatic garbage collection using Boehm's garbage collection library.
Programmers who are new to the C programming language will not need to micro-manage their memory allocations by themselves
while experienced C programmers can take full control and manage their memory manually.
