Enumerators should have a function called cc_enumerator_has_next()
Pre and post conditions
Does cc_object_is_equal check hash values?
byte identifier as type identifier for objects for better performance
unsigned integers maybe yes?
shuffle can have % 0 which gives a zero-division-error
cc_linked_list_new can return null but cc_linked_list_new_with_enumerator does not check for null
